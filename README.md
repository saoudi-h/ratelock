RateLock is a powerful and developer-friendly rate limiting solution for Node.js applications. It's designed to be fast, flexible, and easy to integrate into any project, from small services to large-scale distributed systems.

## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

- **Extensibility:** RateLock is built around a core engine and modular storage adapters. This allows you to choose the right backend for your needs or even build your own.
- **Performance:** By leveraging atomic operations (like Redis Lua scripts) in its adapters, RateLock ensures that rate limiting checks are fast and free of race conditions.
- **Developer Experience:** With a clean, modern API and strong TypeScript support, RateLock is designed to be intuitive and easy to work with.
